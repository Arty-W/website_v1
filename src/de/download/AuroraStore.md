## Features:

- **Anonymous login**: Login anonymously so that you stay private.
- **Google login**: access your paid apps and install beta apps.
- **Device spoofing**: App not available for your device? Use available device configurations to spoof you device!
- **Location spoofing**: With the help of location spoofing and a VPN, you can access gloabally restricted apps!
- **Filter F-Droid app**: Don't want F-Droid apps to be in your update list? Use the filter to exclude them.
- **Blacklist apps**: By blacklisting apps, Google will not know that the selected apps are installed on your device.
