# Privacy Statement for AuroraOSS.com

Effective date: **{{ $frontmatter.published }}**

[[toc]]

## What information AuroraOSS does collect

"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our Users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify them or otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them. Information like your Internet protocol (IP) address is collected within the category “User Personal Information.”

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information that does not identify a User or cannot otherwise be reasonably linked or connected with them.

### Device information

We may collect certain information about your device, such as its IP address, browser or client application information, language preference, operating system and application version, device type and ID, and device model and manufacturer. This information may include User Personal information.

The reason for this is to help us differentiate between real users and bots, so that we can filter them out and block them from sending a certain amount of GET requests. Some bots use very old version of browsers such as Firefox, Chrome & other Chromium browsers, others use special techniques to make themselves look like real users. We do our best to minimize mixups 

## What information AuroraOSS does _not_ collect

We do not and have no means of collecting “[Sensitive Personal Information](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-9-gdpr/)”, such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

## How AuroraOSS uses your information

We use your information for the following purposes:

- We store IP addresses if our server deems the IP 'harmful', due to the fact that a few individuals spam (meaning sending requests every second) our servers with GET requests, which caused some complications in the past.
- We use Usage Information and [Device Information](#device-information) to better understand how our Users use GitHub and to improve our Website and server stability.
- We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.

## Our use of Cookies

We do not require any cookies, which automatically excludes us from being able to store, process or sell your data using cookies. We do however, utilise [localStorage](https://javascript.info/localstorage) for the sole purpose of switching between Light and Dark themes.

## Changes to our Privacy Statement

Although most changes are likely to be minor, AuroraOSS may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page. We will also update the repository to this website, which tracks all changes to this policy. For other changes to this Privacy Statement, we encourage Users to watch or to check our repository frequently.
