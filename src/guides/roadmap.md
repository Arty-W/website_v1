# Roadmap
![Roadmap](https://telegra.ph/file/732c1e50d8c7febfe8c63.png)

The goal of Aurora Store is to provide users an alternative to the Google Play Store that works well, packed with important privacy features as well as stunning and pleasant-looking UI. Here is a list of the important stuff of what we've achieved and changed so far.

✅ = Completed 
  
⏳ = Work In Progress

❓ = Unknown Stage

## version 4

#### ⏳ Remove support for Aurora Services

There will no longer be support for Aurora Services. The reason for this is because there is no point for the continuation of its existence, since the installation method is replaced by Aurora Store:

1. Install Aurora Store as a **system app**. This has the same effect as if you were to install Aurora Services as a system application. This method does not require root but you will need an unlocked bootloader with a custom recovery like TWRP installed. This installation method is called "Session".

2. Install Aurora Store as a **user app**. If you have root access you can give Aurora Store the permissions for "Root" installation method. There is no point to use Aurora Services with root since you can give Aurora Store root permissions already.

3. If you have no root access available, the default installation method will be "Native".


#### ⏳ New UI

Exciting new UI for a new version 😉

#### ❓ Spoofing to be removed from Aurora Store and separate solution for spoofing
::: guide Note
Info has been closed for now.

#### ⏳ Major Token Dispenser API changes and exclusive use for Aurora Store only!

We have seen major issues while observing the main server, and it seems like it has been overloaded with high CPU usages during version 3 recently. Thus, the developer has been trying to counter this with a solution.

After this build has been released, the way token dispensers work will be much different than it is now, which is to help reduce the workload of the main server. The main dispenser server will also now be available for Aurora Store only. This should help lower the chances of server downsides and faster loading times.

#### ⏳ Add new device configurations for spoofing

In this build, a few more device configs with newer versions of Android will be added for device spoofing, as some are rather outdated. This gives users the opportunity to install e.g. apps with features exclusively for Android 11, but not for your device. (Note that you have to have the same Android version for those features to work!)
