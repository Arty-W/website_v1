### Telegram <brand-telegram-icon color="#0088CC" />

Our go-to platform would be Telegram. We are almost active everyday so we won't miss a message if you chime in. Install Telegram if you don't already have it, choose any of the groups below and scan them with a QR Code scanner to get started!

...or click on the QR code images to open the links. (QR codes are cooler, though.)

::: guide Important!
Please read the group rules, pinned messages and a few of the previous messages to see if their context is what you are looking for before asking any questions, you're helping us reduce spam and time! üëç
