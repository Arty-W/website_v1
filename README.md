## About

### Translations

The way translated pages work here is (will be) by using submodules in git. This allows a repository to exist within a repository, meaning we can have many content repositories in different languages without having to edit most of the main repo itself. Please read [this](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255) very well explained git gist on Git Submodules.

Every translation repo is assigned to a team, consisting of members who maintain the repo and check the content regularly. All changes must correspond with this parent repo.

## Browser compatibility

### Chrome/Chromium-based Browsers & Firefox Desktop

You should have no problem with theming or CSS breaking.

### Firefox Mobile (Fenix)

You may experience JS breaking or random reloads while scrolling through the page.

The official Firefox has tons of fixes pending and many things still don't work with the mobile version. If you wish to remain using Firefox Mobile, use [Mull](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/us.spotco.fennec_dos) by DivestOS, which you can download from their [F-Droid repository](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/?fingerprint=E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467): 
- Link: https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/
- Fingerprint: E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467

Their fork has most of the fixes that make it stable and to use. Check out their source code [here](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mull-fenix).

With Mull you won't experience any problems.
