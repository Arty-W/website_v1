# AuroraOSS.com

The remake of our official site for AuroraOSS at auroraoss.com.

## Browser compatibility

### Chrome/Chromium-based Browsers/Firefox Desktop

You should have no problem with theming or CSS breaking.

### Firefox Mobile

The official Firefox has tons of fixes pending and many things still don't work with the mobile version. If you wish to remain using Firefox Mobile, use [Mull](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/us.spotco.fennec_dos) by DivestOS, which you can download from their [F-Droid repository](https://divestos.org/fdroid/official/?fingerprint=E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467):

- Fingerprint: E4BE8D6ABFA4D9D4FEEF03CDDA7FF62A73FD64B75566F6DD4E5E577550BE8467

Their fork has most of the fixes that make it stable and to use. Check out their source code [here](https://gitlab.com/divested-mobile/mull-fenix).

## TODO:
