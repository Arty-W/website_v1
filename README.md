# AuroraOSS.com

The remake of our official site for AuroraOSS at auroraoss.com.

TODO:

-   [ ] add CNAME (and AlgoliaSearch maybe?) after finished
-   [ ] may need to change download strategy, check server structure
-   [ ] add updated faqs from Rahul
-   [ ] add nightly buttons if nightly builds continue
-   [ ] add more language support
-   [ ] import all docs/wiki for all apps if available
-   [ ] Aurora Wallpapers and App Warden mirror repos

Kudos to the team that made Tachiyomi.org for their help.
